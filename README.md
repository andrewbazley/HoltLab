# Image-Analysis
These are several macros I wrote to analyze single nanoparticle microscopy movies. These use Fiji/ImageJ and the MOSAIC 2D/3D particle tracker plugin. Ensure you have the MOSIAC suite installed into fiji before using.
These scripts can be run on a HPC cluster and submitted as a job for batch tracking files using a virtual frame buffer (XVFB, see the .sh file as an example SLURM submission).
